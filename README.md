# Discount Me That

### Challenge

One of the budding wholesale retailers in Capitalville, Mr. Rich Fairsell, has been looking at
ways of boosting the sale numbers for his new online grocery store, Sabzi For Good (SFG). SFG's
inventory has around 1MM products with prices mentioned inclusive of 20% VAT.
He decided to run a marketing campaign sending out limited time unique discount codes to all
~50MM citizens of Capitalville. The customers will be able to put in the discount code on the
checkout page and get 40% off.

coupon code and return the final discounted value to be displayed.

* Each discount code can be used only once
* All order items are discountable
